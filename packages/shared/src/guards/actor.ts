 * R3.4.a — derive the actor's role for the §8.1 guard layer.
 *
 * Per SECURITY §2.1: the request body NEVER supplies `actorUserId` or
 * `actorRole`. The server-side flow is:
 *   1. resolve `userId` from the session cookie,
 *   2. read the user's `PartyMembership` row for the target party,
 *   3. call this function with the `Party` row + the membership.
 *
 * Returns `'banker'` iff the user is the Party's denormalized banker
 * (per OUTLINE §3.14); otherwise the membership's `role`. The banker
 * value can ONLY come from `Party.bankerUserId === membership.userId`
 * — never from a `PartyMembership.role = 'banker'` row.
 *
 * MVP note: `party.bankerUserId` is null in MVP-validated state, so
 * this currently returns `membership.role` always. R4.2 broadens the
 * Zod schema for `Party.bankerUserId` and `PartyMembership.role`.

/**
 * RH2.1a — action-aware `actorRole` derivation shared by the web store
 * dispatch middleware and the server log builder.
 *
 * Prior to RH2.1a the per-action-type mapping lived inline in
 * `apps/web/src/store/index.ts::resolveActor` while the server used the
 * `Actor.role` produced by `deriveActorRole(party, membership)` for
 * every slice. The two sites did NOT agree — the web hard-codes `'dm'`
 * for DM-only actions like `identify` even when the actor's underlying
 * membership role is `player`, while the server relied on the guard
 * layer to reject wrong-role dispatches upstream. This function makes
 * the intent shared: given a state + slice, return the role the actor
 * is wearing for THIS specific action.
 *
 * Three role classes:
 *   - `'dm'`     — DM-only actions per §8.1 (`identify`, `kick-player`,
 *                  `appoint-banker`, `revoke-banker`, `dm-transfer`),
 *                  the bootstrap `create-character` (no banker yet),
 *                  and `seed-catalog` (system-driven per §3.7).
 *   - `'banker'` — the Banker-only `split-evenly` action per §8.1, AND
 *                  player-driven actions where the actor IS the party's
 *                  banker per §3.14 (`state.party.bankerUserId ===
 *                  state.user.id`).
 *   - `'player'` — everything else, when the actor is not the banker.
 *
 * State handling:
 *   - `state === null` is legal ONLY for the bootstrap
 *     `create-character` slice (which carries `userId` + `partyId` on
 *     its payload since the state is being minted right now).
 *     Every other slice requires a populated state and throws.
 *   - Post-bootstrap `create-character` (a joiner or DM-only DM minting
 *     their character against an existing party) is treated as
 *     player-or-banker via `state.user.id` vs `state.party.bankerUserId`.
